1) In Apache 2.4 can't access the javascript folder in our self web site, other folders are works ?
this is caused by javascript-comm.conf in /etc/apache2/conf-enabled

2) The mcrypt extension is missing. Please check your PHP configuration
in ubuntu 14.0.4 LTS OS:
apt-get install php5-mcrypt
ln -s /etc/php5/config.d/mcrypt.ini /etc/php5/mods-available
php5enmod mcrypt
apache2 restart

3) enable rewrite log
add "LogLevel alert rewrite:trace6" to httpd.conf
